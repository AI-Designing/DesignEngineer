## 🏗️ Phase 2 Architecture Design

### 1. Face Selection Intelligence Engine
```
Face Detection → Selection Algorithm → Validation → Operation Execution
```

- **Key Functions**:
  - `detect_available_faces()`: Find all faces in current objects
  - `classify_face_types()`: Categorize faces (planar, cylindrical, etc.)
  - `analyze_face_suitability()`: Determine face suitability for operations

#### B. Intelligent Face Selector (`face_selector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Smart face selection based on user intent
- **Key Functions**:
  - `select_optimal_face()`: Choose best face based on criteria
  - `resolve_face_conflicts()`: Handle multiple candidate faces
  - `validate_face_selection()`: Ensure selection meets requirements

#### C. Advanced Operations Engine (`advanced_operations.py`)
- **Purpose**: Execute complex operations on selected faces
- **Key Functions**:
  - `execute_hole_operation()`: Drill holes with precise positioning
  - `execute_pocket_operation()`: Create pockets with depth control
  - `execute_pattern_operations()`: Create patterns (linear, circular)
