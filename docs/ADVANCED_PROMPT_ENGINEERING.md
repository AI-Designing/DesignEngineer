# Advanced Prompt Engineering for FreeCAD LLM Automation

## Overview

The Advanced Prompt Engineering System revolutionizes how our FreeCAD LLM automation generates code by implementing a structured **Understand → Breakdown → Implement** approach. This sophisticated system dramatically improves code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## System Architecture

### Core Philosophy: Structured Code Generation

Traditional LLM code generation often produces inconsistent results because it jumps directly to implementation. Our advanced system follows a methodical approach:

```
User Requirements → Problem Understanding → Solution Breakdown → Code Implementation → Validation → Optimization
```

## Detailed Implementation

### Problem Complexity Assessment

The system automatically assesses problem complexity to tailor its approach:

```python
class ProblemComplexity(Enum):
    SIMPLE = "simple"           # Basic primitives (boxes, cylinders)
    MODERATE = "moderate"       # Shape combinations and boolean operations
    COMPLEX = "complex"         # Multi-step assemblies with constraints
    ADVANCED = "advanced"       # Parametric designs with dependencies
    EXPERT = "expert"          # Complex mathematical shapes and algorithms
```

### Structured Prompt Templates

#### Understanding Phase Prompt
```
You are an expert FreeCAD automation engineer. Analyze this design problem systematically:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS: {user_requirements}
CURRENT CONTEXT: {context_info}

Provide detailed understanding in JSON format:
{
    "main_objective": "Clear statement of primary goal",
    "key_requirements": ["Requirement 1", "Requirement 2", ...],
    "constraints": ["Constraint 1", "Constraint 2", ...],
    "expected_outputs": ["Output 1", "Output 2", ...],
    "complexity_level": "simple|moderate|complex|advanced|expert",
    "domain_knowledge_needed": ["Knowledge area 1", ...],
    "potential_challenges": ["Challenge 1 with reasoning", ...]
}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Extract core goals, not just surface requirements
2. Identify functional and non-functional requirements
3. Consider technical, resource, and design constraints
4. Anticipate implementation problems and edge cases
```

#### Breakdown Phase Prompt
```
Create detailed step-by-step implementation plan based on problem understanding:

PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING: {understanding_summary}
COMPLEXITY LEVEL: {complexity_level}

Generate implementation plan in JSON format:
[
    {
        "description": "What this step accomplishes",
        "purpose": "Why this step is necessary",
        "freecad_operations": ["Specific FreeCAD operation 1", ...],
        "dependencies": ["step_001", "step_002"],
        "validation_criteria": "How to verify success",
        "expected_result": "What should exist after this step",
        "error_handling": "How to handle failures"
    }
]

PLANNING GUIDELINES:
1. Order steps to build complexity gradually
2. Use specific FreeCAD Python API calls
3. Define clear success criteria for each step
4. Plan for common failure scenarios
```

#### Implementation Phase Prompt
```
Generate complete, production-ready Python code based on analysis and plan:

PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING: {understanding_summary}
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: {steps_summary}
CURRENT CONTEXT: {context_info}

Generate code with JSON response format:
{
    "code": "Complete Python code implementation",
    "explanation": "Detailed explanation of approach",
    "complexity_score": 0.8,
    "confidence_level": 0.9,
    "potential_issues": ["Issue 1", "Issue 2"],
    "optimization_suggestions": ["Suggestion 1", "Suggestion 2"]
}

CODE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Complete, executable Python code
2. Follow FreeCAD Python API conventions
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Add clear comments and docstrings
5. Structure code in logical functions/classes
6. Consider efficiency and resource usage
```

### Quality Metrics and Tracking

The system continuously tracks and improves code quality:

```python
class CodeQualityTracker:
    def track_generation(self, generation_result):
        """Track quality metrics for continuous improvement"""
        quality_score = generation_result.get('validation', {}).get('overall_quality_score', 0.5)
        complexity = generation_result.get('understanding', {}).get('complexity_level', 'moderate')
        
        self.generation_history.append({
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'quality_score': quality_score,
            'complexity': complexity,
            'success': generation_result.get('implementation', {}).get('confidence_level', 0) > 0.7
        })
```

enhanced_llm = EnhancedLLMIntegration(llm_client)

# Generate high-quality code
result = enhanced_llm.generate_enhanced_freecad_code(
    "Create a parametric gear assembly with 20 and 15 teeth",
    context={'precision': 'high', 'parametric': True}
)

# Access structured results
understanding = result['understanding']
breakdown = result['breakdown'] 
implementation = result['implementation']
final_code = result['final_code']
```

### Integration with Enhanced Complex Generator

```python
from src.ai_designer.core.enhanced_complex_generator import EnhancedComplexShapeGenerator

# Enhanced generator automatically uses advanced prompt engineering
generator = EnhancedComplexShapeGenerator(llm_client, state_analyzer, command_executor)

# Generate complex shapes with superior quality
result = generator.generate_enhanced_complex_shape(
    user_requirements="Design a robotic arm joint with servo mount",
    session_id="demo_session",
    generation_mode=GenerationMode.ADAPTIVE
)
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Pattern Learning Integration**
The system learns from successful generations to improve future results:

```python
class PatternLearner:
    def learn_from_success(self, requirements, generated_code, quality_metrics):
        """Learn patterns from successful generations"""
        pattern = self._extract_success_pattern(requirements, generated_code)
        self.success_patterns.append(pattern)
        self._update_pattern_weights(pattern, quality_metrics)
```

### 2. **Adaptive Complexity Handling**
Different complexity levels receive tailored treatment:

```python
def _adapt_prompts_for_complexity(self, complexity_level):
    """Adapt prompt strategy based on complexity"""
    if complexity_level == ProblemComplexity.EXPERT:
        return {
            'understanding_depth': 'maximum',
            'breakdown_granularity': 'fine',
            'validation_rigor': 'comprehensive',
            'optimization_cycles': 3
        }
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Generation**
The system considers session context, user preferences, and historical data:

```python
enhanced_context = {
    'session_history': self._get_session_history(session_id),
    'user_preferences': self._get_user_preferences(),
    'performance_constraints': self._get_performance_constraints(),
    'available_tools': self._get_available_freecad_tools()
}
```

### 4. **Multi-Level Fallback System**
Robust error handling with multiple fallback levels:

```
Advanced Prompt Engineering → Basic Prompt Generation → Emergency Fallback → Error Recovery
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Comprehensive Error Recovery

```python
def generate_enhanced_code(self, requirements, context):
    try:
        # Primary: Advanced prompt engineering
        return self._generate_with_advanced_prompts(requirements, context)
    except Exception as e:
        try:
            # Fallback: Basic prompt generation
            return self._generate_with_basic_prompts(requirements, context)
        except Exception as e2:
            # Emergency: Minimal working code
            return self._create_emergency_fallback(requirements)
```

### Validation and Quality Assurance

```python
def _validate_generated_code(self, code):
    """Multi-level code validation"""
    checks = {
        'syntax_valid': self._check_python_syntax(code),
        'freecad_compliance': self._check_freecad_api_usage(code),
        'logic_valid': self._analyze_code_logic(code),
        'performance_acceptable': self._estimate_performance(code),
        'error_handling_adequate': self._check_error_handling(code)
    }
    return checks
```
