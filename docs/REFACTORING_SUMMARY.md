## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Directory Restructuring
- Created `examples/` directory for usage examples
- Created `scripts/` directory for utility scripts
- Organized documentation in `docs/` with `docs/advanced/` subdirectory

### 2. ✅ File Organization
- **Moved to examples/**: `demo_state_management.py`, `state_cli_example.py`, `websocket_client_example.py`
- **Moved to scripts/**: `run_complex_demo.sh`, `run_tests.sh`
- **Moved to docs/**: `architecture.md` → `docs/architecture.md`
- **Moved to docs/advanced/**: `COMPLEX_SHAPES.md` → `docs/advanced/COMPLEX_SHAPES.md`

### 3. ✅ Package Restructuring
- Created main package: `src/ai_designer/`
- Moved all Python modules into the package with proper namespace
- Created `__main__.py` for CLI entry point
- Reorganized utilities: `analyze.py` → `utils/analysis.py`, `check.py` → `utils/validation.py`

### 4. ✅ Modern Python Packaging
- Created `pyproject.toml` with complete project metadata
- Included all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Added development and documentation dependencies
- Configured build system, linting, and testing tools
- Removed old `requirements.txt`

### 5. ✅ Project Housekeeping
- Created `LICENSE` file with MIT License
- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
- Merged `ENHANCED_README.md` into comprehensive `README.md`
- Updated all documentation to reflect new structure

### 6. ✅ Import Updates
- Updated all Python files to use new `ai_designer` package imports
- Fixed imports in `src/`, `tests/`, and `examples/` directories
- Ensured proper relative imports within the package
- Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

## 🚀 Usage After Refactoring

### Installation
```bash
# Development installation
pip install -e .

# Or with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run the package
python -m ai_designer --help

# Or use the console script
ai-designer --help

# Enhanced mode with full features
ai-designer --enhanced --interactive
```

### Python API Usage
```python
from ai_designer import FreeCADCLI
from ai_designer.core.orchestrator import SystemOrchestrator

# Basic usage
cli = FreeCADCLI()
cli.initialize()
cli.execute_command("Create a cube")

# Enhanced usage
orchestrator = SystemOrchestrator(config)
result = orchestrator.process_user_input_enhanced("Create a building", "session")
```
