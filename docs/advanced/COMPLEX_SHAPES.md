# Complex Shape Generation Enhancement

## 🏗️ Overview

The FreeCAD LLM Automation system has been enhanced to support **complex shape generation** with multiple operations. This allows you to create sophisticated 3D models by combining multiple primitives and operations in a single command.

## 🚀 New Features

### Smart Complex Shape Detection
The system automatically detects when you're requesting a complex shape that requires multiple operations:

```bash
# These commands are automatically detected as complex:
create a cone and cylinder together
build a tower with cone roof
make a rocket with fins
create complex building structure
```

### Multi-Step Processing
Complex requests are automatically broken down into logical steps:

1. **Create individual primitives** (cylinder, cone, etc.)
2. **Position components** relative to each other
3. **Apply Boolean operations** (fusion, positioning)
4. **Finalize the assembly** into a unified object

### Predefined Complex Shapes
The system includes templates for common complex shapes:

- **Cone and Cylinder**: Base cylinder with cone on top
- **Tower**: Multi-level structure with cone roof
- **Rocket**: Body + nose cone + fins
- **Complex Structure**: Base + pillars + roof

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Complex Shapes
```bash
# Simple combination
create a cone and cylinder together

# This executes:
# 1. Create cylinder (radius=5, height=10)
# 2. Create cone (radius=3, height=8) positioned on top
# 3. Fuse cylinder and cone together
```

### Architectural Structures
```bash
# Tower with roof
build a tower with cone roof

# This executes:
# 1. Create base cylinder (radius=8, height=5)
# 2. Create main cylinder (radius=6, height=10) on top
# 3. Create cone roof (radius=6, height=6) on top
# 4. Fuse all parts together
```

### Mechanical Parts
```bash
# Rocket assembly
make a rocket with fins

# This executes:
# 1. Create cylindrical body (radius=4, height=20)
# 2. Create cone nose (radius=4, height=8) on top
# 3. Create 4 small cylindrical fins
# 4. Position fins around the base
# 5. Fuse body and nose together
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Detection Algorithm
The system uses keyword analysis to detect complex requests:

```python
# Keywords that trigger complex processing
complex_keywords = [
    "complex", "combine", "together", "and", "with",
    "tower", "rocket", "structure", "building", "assembly"
]

# Multiple shape detection
shape_words = ["cone", "cylinder", "box", "sphere", "cube"]
shape_count = sum(1 for shape in shape_words if shape in command_lower)
```

### Multi-Step Execution
```python
def execute_complex_shape(self, description):
    # 1. Analyze the request
    # 2. Select appropriate template or generate steps
    # 3. Execute each step sequentially
    # 4. Handle errors gracefully
    # 5. Provide feedback for each step
```

## 🎯 Available Commands

### Interactive Mode Commands
```bash
# Show complex shape examples
complex
examples

# Execute complex shapes
create a cone and cylinder together
build a tower with cone roof
make a rocket with fins
create complex building structure
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Single complex command
echo "create a cone and cylinder together" | python src/main.py --llm-provider google --llm-api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Interactive mode with complex shapes
python src/main.py --llm-provider google --llm-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## 📊 Features and Benefits

### 🔧 Multi-step Processing
- Automatically breaks complex requests into logical steps
- Executes operations in the correct order
- Handles dependencies between operations

### 🎯 Smart Detection
- Recognizes when multiple operations are needed
- Detects complex keywords and multiple shape references
- Falls back to LLM for unknown complex patterns

### 🔄 Sequential Execution
- Executes operations step by step
- Provides feedback for each step
- Continues execution even if individual steps fail

### ⚡ Auto-fusion
- Automatically combines related components
- Uses Boolean operations to create unified objects
- Maintains object relationships

### 📐 Positioning Logic
- Intelligently positions components relative to each other
- Calculates heights and positions automatically
- Ensures proper spatial relationships

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test Script
```bash
# Test cone and cylinder combination
./test_cone_cylinder.sh
```

### Full Demo
```bash
# Complete complex shape demonstration
./demo_complex_shapes.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
cd /home/vansh5632/DesignEng/freecad-llm-automation
source venv/bin/activate
echo -e "create a cone and cylinder together\nstate\nanalyze\ngui\nexit" | python src/main.py --llm-provider google --llm-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## 🎨 Visual Results

When you run complex shape commands, you'll see:

1. **Step-by-step progress** as each operation executes
2. **State updates** showing object count changes
3. **Automatic GUI opening** to visualize the result
4. **Comprehensive analysis** of the created structure

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **More complex templates** (mechanical parts, architectural elements)
- **Parameter customization** for complex shapes
- **Interactive parameter adjustment**
- **Template library** for common industrial shapes
- **Assembly constraints** and relationships

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Use Descriptive Language
```bash
# Good: Describes the desired outcome
create a tower with cone roof

# Better: More specific description
build a lighthouse with cylindrical base and cone top
```

### Combine Keywords
```bash
# Triggers complex detection
create a cone and cylinder together
make a box with cylinder on top
build a complex mechanical assembly
```

### Check Results
```bash
# Always check state after complex operations
create a rocket with fins
state          # Check object count
analyze        # Detailed analysis
gui            # Visual inspection
```

The enhanced system makes it easy to create sophisticated 3D models with natural language commands while maintaining the precision and control needed for engineering applications.
